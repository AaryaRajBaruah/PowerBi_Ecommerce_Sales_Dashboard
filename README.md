# RedMart_Ecommerce_Sales_Deshboard
This is an end to end project on Power Bi Deshboard
<br>
I have created my first Power BI Dashboard representing the analysis of e-commerce sales data.
<br>
Project Learnings:
<br>
• Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data 
<br>
• Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
<br>
• Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations
<br>
• Used different types . of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.) 
<br>
The Dashboard shows the total Profit earned by the store and the total quantity sold yearly; the column chart shows the monthly profit; clustered bar charts are used to show the top 5 subcategories; stacked column charts are used for customers; the donut chart is used to show the payment mode and quantity of the products; and the slicer of the quarter shows quarterly data values.
